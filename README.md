"Egor's Crappy TDS game" is a open-source editable TDS game that is made in pure JAVA.

I made this game to test how java games/applications work and I don't have the money to buy BTD6 :sob:

This game was made by me and with some uh.... some "ai". Specifically Gemini Pro 2.5 (Its also a great AI to do Code [IM NOT DOING A AD HERE!!!])
